Chapter 1 Exercises
-------------------
1. We define Machine Learning by the "engineering-oriented one". That is, a computer program learns
   from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its
   performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
2. Machine learning shines on detecting spam, making recommendations, image classification, and
   fraud detection.
3. A labeled training set is one for which the correct answers are known.
   This would be obtained by having a human classify it correctly.
4. Two common application of supervised tasks are spam filters and predicting target numerical values
   like price of car given a set of features.
5. Four common unsupervised tasks include detecting data about a blog's visitors, clustering data
   to gelp for visualizing, use clustering to detect redundant data in order to implement
   dimensionality reduction, and anamaly detection (like fraud).
6. I would use an unsupervised learning algorithm so that the robot could learn by examining
   terrain. I would imagine some sort of reinforcement would be need though. This would help
   the robot understand good decisions from bad ones.
7. I would use an unsupervised learning algorithm to segment customers into groups. This is
   suited to classification.
8. I would frame spam detection as a supervised learning problem. I would be providing examples of
   spam and non-spam (ham) which would be classified.
9. Online learning corresponds to training a system incrementally by providing small portions of
   data. In doing this, the system can learn incrementally.
10. Out-of-core learning corresponds to an online learning algorithm which is used to train a model
    on a huge dataset that cannot fit in one machine's memory. Online learning is necessary here
    since the full dataset cannot be contained in one machine.
11. Instance based learning relies on a similarity measure to make predictions after memorizing
    by heart some given examples.
12. A model parameter is a variable of the model under consideration. A hyperparameter is a
    parameter of the learning algorithm (i.e. something that modified how the learning algorithm
    operates). An example of a hyperparameter is the amount of regularization. A model parameter
    would be something like the slope from linear regression.
13. Model-based algorithms seek to make predictions based on a constructed model. They seek to make
    predictions by comparing with the model and finding the best approximation. 
14. Four main challenges of machine learning include insufficient quantity of training data,
    non-representative training data, poor quality data, and irrelevant features.
15. This is an example of overfitting. One solution would be to make use of a validation set.
    A second solution would be regularizing in order to ensure the model is only as complex as
    necessary. A third solution may be to choose a different model that is less complex in order
    to fit the situation.
16. A test set is data that would be used to test the effectiveness of a model after training it.
17. A validation set is used in order to help determine optimal hyperparameters.
18. A train-dev set is a portion of the training data set aside in order to test a trained model
    for overfitting. This is used in a situation where the data may not be perfectly representative
    of the data that it will be used for in production.
19. If you tune hyperparameters using the test set the model may end up being too fitted to the test
    set. If it now performs poorly after it would be difficult to see what was causing the trouble.
