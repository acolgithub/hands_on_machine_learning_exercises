# Learning project for Machine Learning

In these files, I will go over exercises from the book ["Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"](https://www.amazon.ca/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646). Included will be workbooks from each chapter where I work through all examples for understanding. In addition, I will attempt to answer all questions from each completed chapter to reinforce my learning.
